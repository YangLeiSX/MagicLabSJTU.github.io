abstract: Current state-of-the-art approaches for lip reading are based on sequence-to-sequence architectures that are designed for natural machine translation and audio speech recognition. Hence, these methods do not fully exploit the characteristics of the lip dynamics, causing two main drawbacks. First, the short-range temporal dependencies, which are critical to the mapping from lip images to visemes, receives no extra attention. Second, local spatial information is discarded in the existing sequence models due to the use of global average pooling (GAP). To well solve these drawbacks, we propose a Temporal Focal block to sufficiently describe short-range dependencies and a Spatio-Temporal Fusion Module (STFM) to maintain the local spatial information and to reduce the feature dimensions as well. From the experiment results, it is demonstrated that our method achieves comparable performance with the state-of-the-art approach using much less training data and much lighter Convolutional Feature Extractor. The training time is re- duced by 12 days due to the convolutional structure and the local self-attention mechanism.
